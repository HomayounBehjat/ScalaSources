This is a basic implementation of a CafeXSnacks Food, Drinks, Order and Bill processing.
The implementation can certainly be much improved upon for a production environment.
Its by no means complete!
I have done this whilst contemplating implementations of Rules and bill processing using Scala.

I believe Scala's succinct and functional coding style allows for more understandable and maintainable
software applications.

I plan to replace the rules handling at a future release and replace it with a rules engine or
I might just tap into a rules engine library already available in Scala.

I also intend to enhance the whole implementation for a real life production ready installation.
